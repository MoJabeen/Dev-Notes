# Basic Statistics

### What is the bernoulli and binomial distribution ?

Bernoulli distribution: The random variable can either be 0 or 1. 
Binomial distribution: The random variable remains to have only two states, this shows the probability of measuring either state x number of times given n independent occurrences.

###Â What is the mean, expectation and standard deviation?

The mean is the frequency of each value occurring, multiplied by the value all summed for each random variable.

$\overline{x} = 1/n(\Sigma fx)$

The expectation is the probability of each value multiplied by the value, summed for all values. This is the value the mean tends to as the sample size increases.

$E(x) = \Sigma x P(X=x)$

The variance is the average of the squared difference from the mean.

$\sigma^2 = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2$

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, showing essentially the average distance from the mean.

$\sigma$
