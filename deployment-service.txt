DECRIP: This doc is notes on the deployment of services to a server

Three models of service infastructure:

SaaS : Software as a Service
PaaS: Platform as a Service
IaaS : Infracture as a Service


SaaS: Pure app accessed through web no dev needed
PaaS: Platform to deploy and manage your own apps - middleware managed
IaaS: Hardware to use for apps

PaaS open source solutions:

OKD (OpenShift Orgin) - Highly reccomended
Cloud Foundry - Back up option with good suggest tutorial videos
